# Cyberbullying Detection in Indonesian Tweets Using NLP and Machine Learning
A machine learning project focused on detecting cyberbullying in Indonesian tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repository compares three algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes, for classification.

## Project Overview
Cyberbullying detection is a crucial application in combating online harassment and promoting safe online spaces. This project uses a dataset containing social media text labeled for instances of cyberbullying and implements machine learning models to classify the text.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Includes tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF).
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements various classification models, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the notebook:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
